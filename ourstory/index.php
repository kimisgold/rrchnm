                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>We use digital media and computer technology to democratize history: to incorporate multiple voices, reach diverse audiences, and encourage popular participation in presenting and preserving the past.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="container">
            <p>Since 1994&mdash;under the founding direction of Roy Rosenzweig&mdash;the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media has worked to create software and websites that are freely available to the public.</p>

            <p>Those digital projects emerge from our engagement with the practice of history in universities, schools, libraries, archives, museums, and communities. They are shaped by collaborations with practitioners and audiences, and are produced by teams of researchers, developers, designers and graduate students.</p>

            <p>In 2014, our projects attracted over 30 million visits and 18 million unique visitors.</p>

            <p>We depend on grant funds from government agencies and private organizations to support this work.</p>

            <p>An endowment provided by the NEH and over 300 donors, and support from CHSS and the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University, help support the infrastructure of the Center.</p>

            <p>We encourage you to explore our work, get to know our staff, follow our activities, and consider how you might work with us.</p>
